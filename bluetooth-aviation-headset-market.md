<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bluetooth Aviation Headset Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) Headsets</li><li>Active Noise Reduction (ANR) Headsets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bluetooth aviation headset market is primarily divided into two types: Passive Noise Reduction (PNR) headsets and Active Noise Reduction (ANR) headsets. PNR headsets block external noise through physical means, using materials that cushion and seal around the ears, making them effective in quieter environments. In contrast, ANR headsets use electronic technology to actively cancel out unwanted ambient sounds, providing superior noise reduction in louder settings. Both types enhance communication and comfort for pilots and passengers alike.</p></p>
