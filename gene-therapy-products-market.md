<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy products can be categorized into two primary market types: ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo gene therapy involves removing cells from a patient, genetically modifying them in the laboratory, and then reintroducing them into the patient. This method allows for precise control over the modification process. In vivo gene therapy, on the other hand, involves directly delivering genetic material into the patient's body, targeting specific tissues or cells, providing a more straightforward, less invasive approach.</p></p>
