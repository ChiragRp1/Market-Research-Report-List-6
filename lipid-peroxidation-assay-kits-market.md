<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lipid Peroxidation Assay Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Colorimetric</li><li>Fluorometric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lipid peroxidation assay kits are essential tools for measuring oxidative stress in biological samples. The market is primarily divided into two types: colorimetric and fluorometric assays. Colorimetric assays rely on a color change in the sample that correlates with lipid peroxidation levels, making them easy to read using standard spectrophotometry. In contrast, fluorometric assays utilize fluorescent probes that emit light proportional to lipid peroxidation, offering higher sensitivity and specificity. Both methods are widely used in research and clinical applications.</p></p>
