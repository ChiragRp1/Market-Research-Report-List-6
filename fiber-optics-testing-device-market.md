<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optics Testing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Mode</li><li>Mutimode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optics testing device market is categorized into two main types: single mode and multimode. Single mode fibers have a smaller core diameter, allowing light to travel directly down the fiber, which results in higher speeds and longer distances, making them ideal for telecommunications and long-haul applications. In contrast, multimode fibers have a larger core, enabling multiple light modes to propagate, but are typically used for shorter distances, such as within buildings or campuses. Testing devices for both types ensure performance and reliability in fiber optic networks.</p></p>
