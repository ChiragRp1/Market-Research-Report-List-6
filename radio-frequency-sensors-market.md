<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio Frequency Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radio Frequency Sensors are classified into two types: Passive and Active. Passive RF sensors do not have their own power source and rely on an external signal to operate, making them lower cost and simpler but with limited range. On the other hand, Active RF sensors have their own power source and can transmit their own signals, allowing for greater range and functionality but at a higher cost. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on their requirements.</p></p>
