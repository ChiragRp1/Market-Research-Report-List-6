<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Chamber ICD</li><li>Dual-Chamber ICD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) market consists of two primary types: Single-Chamber ICD and Dual-Chamber ICD. Single-Chamber ICDs are designed to monitor and treat arrhythmias in one heart chamber, typically the right ventricle, making them simpler and less invasive. In contrast, Dual-Chamber ICDs monitor both the atrium and ventricle, providing more comprehensive data and treatment for patients with more complex cardiac issues. The choice between them often depends on the patient's specific medical needs and heart condition.</p></p>
