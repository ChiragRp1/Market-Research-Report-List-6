<p><strong>The Grid-connected Installation Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized Grid Connection</li><li>Distributed Grid Connection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Grid-connected installations refer to systems that connect directly to the electrical grid, facilitating electricity exchange. Centralized grid connections involve large-scale power plants, where electricity is generated and transmitted to the grid from a single or few locations. In contrast, distributed grid connections consist of multiple smaller systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, generating power closer to the point of consumption. Both applications enhance energy reliability, optimize resource use, and support the transition to renewable energy sources.</p></p>
