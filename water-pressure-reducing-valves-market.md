<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Pressure Reducing Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting Type</li><li>Pilot Operated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water pressure reducing valves market consists of two primary types: direct acting and pilot operated. Direct acting valves are simple devices that provide immediate pressure regulation through a diaphragm and spring mechanism, ideal for low to moderate flow rates. In contrast, pilot operated valves use a smaller pilot valve to control a larger main valve, allowing for more precise pressure regulation and higher flow rates, making them suitable for industrial applications. Both types enhance system efficiency and protect plumbing infrastructure.</p></p>
