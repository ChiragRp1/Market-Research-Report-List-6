<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gastrointestinal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Covered Gastrointestinal Stents</li><li>Partially Covered Gastrointestinal Stents</li><li>Non-Covered Gastrointestinal Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gastrointestinal stent market encompasses three main types: fully covered, partially covered, and non-covered stents. Fully covered gastrointestinal stents are entirely coated with a material that prevents tissue ingrowth, suitable for strictures or obstructions. Partially covered stents have exposed areas, allowing tissue integration while minimizing migration risks. Non-covered stents, lacking any coating, promote tissue ingrowth but have a higher risk of obstruction due to tissue overgrowth. Each type serves specific clinical needs based on stent placement and intended outcomes.</p></p>
