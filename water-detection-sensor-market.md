<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Detection Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Water Sensors</li><li>Non-contacting Water Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water detection sensor market comprises two primary types: contact water sensors and non-contact water sensors. Contact water sensors detect moisture by direct contact with water, typically using conductive or resistive methods, making them suitable for applications requiring immediate detection. In contrast, non-contact water sensors utilize technologies like ultrasonic or infrared to identify water presence without physical contact, allowing for versatile installation and less wear over time. Both types serve critical roles in leakage detection, flood prevention, and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
