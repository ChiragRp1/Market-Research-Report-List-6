<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical X-ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical X-ray Flat Panel Detector market includes two primary types: indirect conversion and direct conversion detectors. Indirect conversion detectors utilize a two-step process, where X-rays are first converted to visible light using scintillator materials, which is then transformed into an electrical signal, offering enhanced image quality. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals using amorphous selenium layers, resulting in higher spatial resolution and quicker imaging. Both technologies are essential for modern radiographic applications, providing varied benefits.</p></p>
