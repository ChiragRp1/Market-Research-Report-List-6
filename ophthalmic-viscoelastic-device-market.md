<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cohesive OVDs</li><li>Dispersive OVDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Devices (OVDs) are commonly used during eye surgeries to maintain space, protect delicate tissues, and facilitate better surgical outcomes. There are two main types of OVDs - Cohesive OVDs and Dispersive OVDs. Cohesive OVDs have a higher molecular weight and tend to stick together, providing more stable protection and space maintenance. Dispersive OVDs have lower viscosity and tend to spread out thinly, providing better tissue protection and lubrication during surgery. Both types play important roles in various ophthalmic procedures.</p></p>
